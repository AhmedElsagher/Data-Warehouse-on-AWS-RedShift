# Sparkify

## Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

## Project Datasets

we'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

-   Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
-   Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

Log data json path: `s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

```
### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## DWH Design

### Staging Tables
These tables are just the dump of the data from S3 

Using the Staging Tables, i created a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

#### Fact Table

1.  **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong`
    -   _songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent_

#### Dimension Tables

2.  **users** - users in the app
    -   _user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level_
3.  **songs** - songs in music database
    -   _song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration_
4.  **artists** - artists in music database
    -   _artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude_
5.  **time** - timestamps of records in **songplays** broken down into specific units
    -   _start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday_


## How to Run 
1. install Postgres and its wrapper in python psycopg2 then connect to your cluster add cluster credentials in dwh.cfg
2. Create tables   `python create_tables.py`
3.   Populate tables  `python etl.py`
